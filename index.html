    <h1>My Story - By Ethan Jim</h1>
    <h2>Friends</h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, there lived two friends. Jerry and Tim. At Christmas
      Jerry got two presents from his friend Tim. He gave two other presents
      back. They bought one candy cane stick and shared. Tim got the top while
      jerry got the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day their friendship broke because of Tom, their worst enemy. Tom
      hid behind long grass which grew near Tim’s house. Tom threw a stone on to
      Jerry’s head. When Jerry turned back, he only saw Tim. Tim and Jerry had a
      big fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their parents had to pull them apart like pulling two giant magnets! That
      night Jerry’s parents told him that it was Tom who threw a stone at his
      head then Jerry apologized to Tim and Tim apologized to Jerry. They needed
      to plan a trap for Tom, so they did so. They put a chcolate on Toms path.
      But when Tom tried to take it, Jerry and Tim pounced on Tom and Jerry
      asked: “Will you ever throw a stone on my head?” “Nope” said Tom. They let
      Tom go and Tim said to Jerry to call his family to Tim’s house to watch
      scary movies. At night they both watched scary movies with their parents.

      So now you know that Friendship is the strongest thing. THE END😉 😊
